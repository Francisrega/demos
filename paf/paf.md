# Introduction

## About this Demo

**Oracle AI Database Private Agent Factory** is a no-code platform to rapidly build, evaluate, deploy, and operate intelligent AI agents — securely and at scale. Enterprises want AI agents, but building them requires stitching together data access, model hosting, CI/CD, monitoring, and evaluation across fragmented frameworks. Worse, private enterprise data cannot be sent to public LLMs. Private Agent Factory solves both problems by running entirely inside the Oracle security boundary, bringing AI directly to your data with no data movement and no custom development required.

### What You'll Discover:

- **Build Agent**: Watch the visual Agent Builder canvas come to life — nodes (Trigger, LLM, DB Lookup, Tool Call, Output) snap into place with animated connector lines showing execution flow. No code written.
- **Knowledge RAG**: See enterprise sources (SharePoint, websites, PDFs, Oracle AI Database tables) ingested and vectorized privately using Oracle AI Vector Search, then watch a user query return a fully sourced, traceable answer — 100% inside the Oracle security boundary.
- **Analyze Data**: Experience the Data Analysis Agent translate a plain English prompt into SQL, then auto-generate a regional revenue chart with a written narrative insight. Zero SQL knowledge required.
- **Govern & Guard**: Observe the governance perimeter assemble — SSO controls, the Private AI Container, a zero-leakage shield, guardrails, and compliance audit logging all locking into place.
- **Deploy Anywhere**: Follow the complete architecture from business user through Private Agent Factory Runtime to Oracle AI Database and Private LLM — portable across on-prem, OCI, or any cloud via Agent Spec.

### Key Benefits:

- **No-code for everyone**: Business users and developers build, test, and deploy agents using a drag-and-drop builder with reusable templates — no coding or custom orchestration required.
- **Zero data leakage**: All LLM inference and embedding generation runs inside the Oracle perimeter via the Private AI Services Container. AI is brought to the data, not the other way around.
- **Pre-built agents, immediate value**: Knowledge-Based RAG and Data Analysis agents are tuned to Oracle Database best practices and ready for production from day one.
- **Complete agent lifecycle**: Visual builder, runtime orchestration, grounding, guardrails, evaluation workflows, and monitoring — all in one platform.
- **Deploy anywhere**: On-prem, OCI, or any cloud IaaS. Broad LLM choice with full portability via Agent Spec export and import.
- **Enterprise governance built in**: SSO, role-based access, audit trails, safety guardrails, and evaluation workflows — SOX, GDPR, and HIPAA-ready by design.
